# Domain-Decomposition
Domain Decomposition in C using threads

## Description
Considering the domain decomposition of a 2D data-structure, implement six (06) separate pthread 
applications in C:

1.  Row-wise block distribution 
2. Column-wise block distribution 
3. Row and Column-wise block distribution (Block, Block Distributions) 
4. Row-wise cyclic distribution 
5. Column-wise cyclic distribution 
6. Row and Column-wise cyclic distribution (Block, Block Distributions)
   
These multi-threaded applications should be executed using 04 Threads or parallel tasks. You can chose 
any of the following applications (having a 2D matrix of size 1024*1024 elements of type int) to be 
implemented as these pthread applications: 
- Sum of all rows
- Sum of all columns
- Sum of all elements
